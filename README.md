Hi there 👋
================
I'm a **Software Engineer** mainly focused on front-end, with a passion for developing beautiful applications. I graduated **RIT** with a major on Web & Mobile Computing, Minor in Software Engineering and an immersion in Mathematics. I have developed everything from automated scripts, to JavaScript (Express.js) and Python (Django) back-ends & APIs as well as several front-ends with React.js. I've deployed with several cloud services such as Heroku, Azure and Amazon Web Services.

I'm currently looking for full-time positions.
