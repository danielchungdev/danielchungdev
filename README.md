Hi there 👋
================
My name is Daniel Chung and I'm a **Full-Stack engineer** from Panama 🇵🇦. I'm currently studying Web & Mobile Computing @ **Rochester Institute of Technology**. I have developed everything from automated scripts, to JavaScript (Express.js) and Python (Django) back-ends & APIs as well as several front-ends with React.js. I've deployed with several cloud services such as Heroku and Amazon Web Services.

I'm currently looking for co-op/internships for Fall 2021 or Spring 2022 and expected graduation Fall 2022.
